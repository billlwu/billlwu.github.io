I follow US politics. Below are my notes/thoughts:

(2020/May 7) A group of four Republican senators -- Tom Cotton (AR); Ted Cruz (TX); Chuck Grassley (IA); and Josh Hawley (MO) -- urged Trump to suspend OPT along with several guest worker programs, arguing, “There is certainly no reason to allow foreign students to stay for three additional years just to take jobs that would otherwise go to unemployed Americans as our economy recovers.”

(May 29) Trump said the US will begin eliminating policy exemptions that have afforded Hong Kong special trading status with the US since 1997. Killing of George Floyd, and before him, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and others sparked violent protests in several US cities.

(June 1) Trump has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact designed to pressure China to meet international rules; the Paris climate accord; the 2015 Iran nuclear deal; the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia to limit nuclear weapons; UNESCO, the U.N.’s educational, scientific, and cultural agency; the Open Skies Treaty that allowed countries to fly over each other to monitor military movements. 

(June 4) The key to Trump’s popularity has been a rhetorical strategy identified by political philosopher Eric Hoffer in *The True Believer* (1951). Hoffer noted that demagogues needed a disaffected population whose members felt they had lost the power they previously held, that they had been displaced either religiously, economically, culturally, or politically. Such people were willing to follow a leader who promised to return them to their former positions of prominence and thus to make the nation great again. But to cement their loyalty, the leader had to give them someone to hate. Who that was didn’t really matter: the group simply had to be blamed for all the troubles the leader’s supporters were suffering.

(Nov 11) [Odd Lots](https://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/odd_lots) episode: Jake Sherman (Politico reporter) argues the only important politics players are "the 4 corners" (Pelosi, Schumer, McCarthy, McConnell) and Trump, while others are noise. A deal is made (e.g. CARES) when their interests are aligned. Otherwise someone saying "I'm optimistic about a deal" means little.  In an ideal world there might be an automatic stabilizer (a check every time unemployment reaches 12%), or debt ceiling. It's unlikely because it'd mean Congress gives up its power (no more room for leverage and bargains).

(Dec 15) About 5 weeks after major news media projected the US election, Senate majority leader McConnell recognizes Biden as President-elect. This is after Trump and co went through recounts, lawsuits, meetings with state legislature officials from MI, Supreme Court defeat. Trump did not concede so he could attract political donations.

(Dec 16) Very informative piece in [Bloomberg Opinion](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-09-21/tiktok-s-algorithm-can-t-be-trusted) on *recommendor systems*. Too bad the author felt the need to politicize her title. Dr. O'Neil has had an exciting career path (math PhD, professor, quant, data science and opinion writer). Some of her work is posted [here](https://mathbabe.org/contact/).
