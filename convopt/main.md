title: Convex Optimization

I'm going through the text by Boyd and Vandenberghe. Below are my notes:

(2020/12/18) Read about affine and convex sets. The convex combination of pts A, B is ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Coverline%7BAB%7D), of points A, B, C is ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20ABC), of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_1%2C%20x_2%2C%20...%2C%20x_k) is ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cleft%20%5C%7B%20%5Csum%5E%7Bk%7D%5Ctheta_ix_i%7C%20%5Csum%5Ek%20%5Ctheta_i%3D1%2C%20%5Ctheta_i%5Cgeq0%2Ci%3D1%2C...k%20%5Cright%20%5C%7D). The *convex hull* is the set of all convex combinations of points in the set.
