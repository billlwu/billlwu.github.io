title: Trading and Exchanges
---

I'm going through Larry Harris' *Trading and Exchanges*. Below are my notes:

(12/30) The table of content is on 12/657. 

Since the book was published, CME has acquired the Chicago Board of Trade (2006), NY Mercantile Exchange (2008), Kansas City BOT (2012), and has 24% ownership of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. This book in 7 parts (p22) explains how trading markets are organized and how their rules affects traders. Some key recurrent themes are (p20):
- information asymmetry
- option to trade (limit orders give free trading options to other traders)
- externalities (such as the order flow externality: traders who offer to trade give others options to trade for which they aren't compensated. Pay attention to when, why, how traders offer to trade)
- market structure
- competition with free entry and exit
- communications and computing technologies ("markets are information-processing mechanisms")
- price correlations (markets for similar instruments are closely related)
- principal-agent problems (client-broker relationship)
- trustworthiness and creditworthiness
- the zero-sum game (a trade involves 2 sides: accounting gains must offset each other)
