Here's a little about me:  

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sizhao-bill-wu/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/billl.wu); write me an email billsizhao.wu at gmail dot com.
- I grew up in Beijing and came to Swarthmore, PA for college in 2011.
- During my senior year, I designed and built an electrodynamic shaketable to simulate earthquakes. Here is an CAD [sketch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hsv2x8rk3nfot97/table_frame.PNG?dl=0) for the frame, me getting a structure ready for [testing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pvjqdtjptgckrcy/20150430_164630.jpg?dl=0) in the basement of Hicks, testing the control system for the [motor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h2y85o97888gkd1/20150502_173739.mp4?dl=0), and some [shaking](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n5qw488mvfc41ln/20150502_172903.mp4?dl=0) in progress.
- This experience (machine shop construction, structural dynamics, linear systems analysis) led me to pursue a PhD in civil engineering at Cornell University, under the guidance of professor Greg McLaskey. I was once [featured](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/spotlights/bill-wu-phd-student) by our department; some of our group's published work on earthquake physics is listed [here](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mclaskey/publications.html).
- In the winter of 2018 while I was attending a geophysics conference in DC, my friend sent me a few papers on trading strategies and made me realize some signal processing techniques I applied to seismic time series (e.g. filtering, FFT) are transferrable to financial market data. I also started going through a couple of texts on statistical learning (ISLR, ESL).
- In the summers of 2019 and 2020, I did internships in quantitative finance at a [startup hedge fund](http://arcstonecap.com/index.html) and a [high-frequency  trading firm](https://www.quantlab.com/).
- I plan to defend my PhD thesis around May/June 2021.
- I am excited to start as a junior trader at [Gelber Group](https://www.gelbergroup.com/) in Chicago after my defense. 


Between now (Dec, 2020) and when I start work, my attention is split between writing my dissertation and self-learning some subjects I'm interested in, including [statistics](/ml.md), [algorithms](/algo.md), [convex optimization](/convopt.md), [adaptive market hypothesis](/AMH.md), [reinforcement learning](/rl.md), [quant trading](/quant.md), and [US politics](Politics.md).
