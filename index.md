## Bill Wu 武思兆

Here's a little about me:  

- Grew up in Beijing, China. Came to the US for college in 2011.
- During my senior year at Swarthmore College, I designed and built an electrodynamic [shaketable](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/16600) to simulate earthquakes. 
- This experience led me to pursue a PhD in civil engineering at Cornell University, under the guidance of professor Greg McLaskey. I was once [featured](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/spotlights/bill-wu-phd-student) by our department; some of our published work on earthquake physics is [here](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mclaskey/publications.html). 
- In the summers of 2019 and 2020, I've done internships in quantitative finance at a [startup hedge fund](http://arcstonecap.com/index.html) and a [high-frequency  trading firm](https://www.quantlab.com/). 
- I'm excited about machine learning, reinforcement learning and their applications to finance. I'm also reading about the efficient market hypothesis and adaptive market hypothesis to form an understand of how financial market behavior can be explained using tools from statistics, biology, psychology, etc.
- I'll write down some thoughts from various readings here.
