Quantivity [blogpost](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/why-log-returns/) on why log returns are nice. If we define returns as ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20r_i%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bp_i-p_j%7D%7Bp_i%7D), where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20j%5Cequiv%20i-1). Then ri is normalized, 1+ri and compound return are both lognormal.

Important to distinguish between *alpha model* and *risk model*. Alpha model describes how you make money; risk model describes the downside risk exposure.
