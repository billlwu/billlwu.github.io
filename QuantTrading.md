Quantivity [blogpost](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/why-log-returns/) on why log returns are nice. Definitions:

- log return = ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clog%281&plus;r_i%29%3D%5Clog%28%5Cfrac%7Bp_i%7D%7Bp_j%7D%29)

Important to distinguish between *alpha model* and *risk model*. Alpha model describes how you make money; risk model describes the downside risk exposure.
