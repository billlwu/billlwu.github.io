I'm going through an MIT OCW [6.006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm), which uses the CLRS book. Below are my notes:

2020/Dec

[Artificial Intelligence - The Revolution hasnâ€™t Happened Yet](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wot7mkc1/release/9), by Michael I. Jordan (statistic/CS prof from Berkeley; Andrew Ng was his PhD student). Jordan proposes a "manifesto" for a human-centric engineering discipline that integrates AI (in the sense abused by the public: big data + deep learning to mimick some narrowly defined human skill), Intelligence Augmentation IA, Intelligent Infrastructure II.

A nice [commentary](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/pjebp7io/release/4) by Andrew Lo proposes that AI need to model not just ideal behavior (via the perfect optimizer), but human behavior (newcomers, people with imperfect information) before the AI revolution envisioned by Jordan can take place. His piece also argues that fake news exploits our cognitive bias and the sparsity of memory to sway opinion.
