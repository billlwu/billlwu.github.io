[Artificial Intelligence - The Revolution Hasnâ€™t Happened Yet](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wot7mkc1/release/9), by Michael I. Jordan (statistic/CS prof from Berkeley; Andrew Ng was his PhD student). The author proposes a "manifesto" for a human-centric engineering discipline that integrates AI (used in the sense abused by the public: big data + deep learning to mimick some narrowly-defined human skill), Intelligence Augmentation IA, and Intelligent Infrastructure II.

A nice [commentary](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/pjebp7io/release/4) by Andrew Lo proposes that AI needs to model not just ideal behavior (via the perfect optimizer), but human behavior (newcomers, people with imperfect information) before the AI revolution envisioned by Jordan can take place. His piece also argues that fake news can easily exploit our cognitive bias and the sparsity of memory to sway opinion.
